## 🔍 EDA Highlights

In this project, I performed:

- ✅ Data cleaning and preprocessing
- ✅ Missing value handling (`Age`, `Embarked`, `Cabin`)
- ✅ Univariate analysis (distribution of features)
- ✅ Bivariate analysis (survival rate by gender, class, etc.)
- ✅ Visualizations using `Matplotlib` and `Seaborn`
- ✅ Feature engineering ideas

### 📌 Key Insights

- Female passengers had a significantly higher survival rate.
- First-class passengers were more likely to survive.
- Younger passengers (children) had a better chance of survival.
